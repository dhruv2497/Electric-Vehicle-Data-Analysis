## DAX Functions Used
The following DAX functions were used to calculate key metrics:
1. **Total Vehicles**:
   ```DAX
   Total Vehicles = DISTINCTCOUNT(Electric_Vehicle_Population_Data[DOL Vehicle ID])
   ```
2. **Average Electric Range**:
   ```DAX
   Avg. Electric Range = CONCATENATE(FORMAT(AVERAGE(Electric_Vehicle_Population_Data[Electric Range]), "0.00"), "Km")
   ```
3. **BEV Vehicles**:
   ```DAX
   BEV Vehicles = CALCULATE([Total Vehicles], Electric_Vehicle_Population_Data[Electric Vehicle Type] = "Battery Electric Vehicle (BEV)")
   ```
4. **Percentage of BEV Vehicles**:
   ```DAX
   %age of BEV Vehicles = [BEV Vehicles] / [Total Vehicles]
   ```
5. **PHEV Vehicles**:
   ```DAX
   PHEV Vehicles = CALCULATE([Total Vehicles], Electric_Vehicle_Population_Data[Electric Vehicle Type] = "Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicle (PHEV)")
   ```
6. **Percentage of PHEV Vehicles**:
   ```DAX
   %age of PHEV Vehicles = [PHEV Vehicles] / [Total Vehicles]
   ```
